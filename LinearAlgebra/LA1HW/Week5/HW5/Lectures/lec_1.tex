\begin{problem}
Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space and let $T$ be a linear operator on $V$. Suppose that $\operatorname{rank}(T^{2})=\operatorname{rank}(T)$. Prove that the range and null space of $T$ are disjoint, i.e., have only the zero vector in common.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Let $p,m,$ and $n$ be positive integers and $F$ a field. Let $V$ be the space of $m\times n$ matrices over $F$ and let $W$ be the space of $p\times n$ matrices over $F$. Let $B$ be a fixed $p\times m$ matrix and let $T$ be the linear transformation from $V$ into $W$ defined by $T(A)=BA$. Prove that $T$ is invertible if and only if $p=m$ and $B$ is an invertible $m\times m$ matrix.
\end{problem}

\section*{Section 3.5}
\begin{problem}
If $A$ and $B$ are $n\times n$ matrices over the field $F$, show that $\operatorname{trace}(AB)=\operatorname{trace}(BA)$. Now show that similar matrices have the same trace.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Let $V$ be the vector space of all polynomial functions $p$ from $\mathbb{R}$ into $\mathbb{R}$ which have degree $2$ or less:
\[
p(x)=c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2.
\]
Define three linear functionals on $V$ by
\[
f_1(p)=\int_0^1 p(x)\,dx,\qquad
f_2(p)=\int_0^2 p(x)\,dx,\qquad
f_3(p)=\int_{0}^{-1} p(x)\,dx.
\]
Show that $\{f_1,f_2,f_3\}$ is a basis for $V^*$ by exhibiting the basis for $V$ of which it is the dual.
